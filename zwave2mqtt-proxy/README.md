# Home Assistant Add-on: ZWave2MQTT Proxy

⚠️ This addon does not contain ZWave2MQTT ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an external running ZWave2MQTT instance. 
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a ZWave2MQTT icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of an external running ZWave2MQTT instance.
